# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
This Folder contains projects that I perfomed during the 2022 Winter semester at BYUI in the Intro to Data Programming class (CSE250).
For  this folder I selected the analyisis I enjoyed most doing for that class. 
For each of these projects I included the python script and the final PDF version through Markdown. 

###1 Names Analysis: 
In this Project we are trying to identify certain values during a certain time frame. We have a set of data with over hundreds lines of data that we want to transform into visualization.

###2 Flights Analysis (Json):
Throughout this project we take a Json dataframe to identify the data of several airports and their records on flight time, we analyze this information and create tables and charts to identify the variables that affect airports and flights.

###3 Basebal Analysis (SQL):
Throughout this project we beging looking into SQL and how some queries can help us to find certain and very specific information within a database. For the sake of fun our database is going to be about Baseball and some of the math behind the sport, we will find very interesting information.

###4 House Analysis (Machine Learning):
hroughout this project we will learn about Machine Learning, We will take a close sight to ceratin data and analyze it based on the information that we can extract from it and the applying the principles learned on the topic, generate charts that can help us visualize and generate a knowledge on such data.
We analyze data on Houses in the Colorado state comparing the before and after "1980".
